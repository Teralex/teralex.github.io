Hi,
I attached the design. Here the specifications:
In general
-      One-page Wordpress site.
-      When you scroll down the page, the navigation bar stays visible at the top of the page. When you click an item, you will slide directly to that part of the page.
-      Multilingual (NL, EN, FR)
-      Retina ready.
-      Fully responsive.
-      No use of plugins, except “contact form 7”, “Polylang” and “ACF (advanced custom fields)”.
-      Basically everything is dynamic. I think it’s clear what’s clickable etc.
The page
-          The header is a slider; only the png image (the pots) inside will slide.
-          Seasons & Trends section will work about the same as the MoreLIPS Assortment section (see http://morelips.nl/).

o   Skip the indoor / outdoor and search functionality. It’s just a slider and when you click it, it pops up and shows the collection. 
Skip the order by and select pot size functionality.

o   When you click an collection item, you’ll see the product with all the specifications the same as on MoreLIPS.nl. 
These are the specifications we like to use: Name, Code, Potsize & Height. No icons, just text.

o   Furthermore; the user can share a product and return to the collection.

o   Use a custom post type for this: “products” and set ‘collection’ as a taxonomy. 
The title of a product is the name of the product and set custom text fields for the product specifications.
